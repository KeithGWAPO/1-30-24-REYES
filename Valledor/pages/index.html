    <h3>Rules of Baseball:</h3>
        <ol>  
                <li>The uncaught third strike, sometimes called the dropped third strike, is a rule in baseball involving the catcher.</li>
                <li>Though not technically a rule in itself, tie goes to the runner is a very popular interpretation of the out rules in baseball.</li>
                <li>The infield fly rule is a controversial rule that allows the on-field umpires to call a batter or runner out if they hit a fly ball in the infield with players on base.</li>
                <li>A balk occurs when a pitcher performs an illegal motion, usually pretending to pitch the baseball without actually performing a pitch. </li>
                <li>In baseball, there are both fair and foul balls. Fair balls are batted balls that land inside the first and third base foul lines.</li>
                <li>The “pinch” substitution rule is one that is fairly unique to the sport of baseball.</li>
                <li>Tagging up is an extremely important rule in baseball and plays a key role in how teams run the bases and record outs.</li>
                <li>The ambidextrous pitcher rule was added when pitcher Pat Venditte joined the MLB.</li>
                <li>Similar to football and basketball, Major League Baseball has a video replay review system in order to review certain types of calls.</li>
                <li>A ground rule double occurs when a ball is fairly hit and lands in the field of play but then leaves the field of play without interference from a fielder.</li>
            </ol>
